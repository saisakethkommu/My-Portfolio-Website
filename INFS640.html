Grading Policy

Student grades will be determined based on class participation, assignments, research paper review, research paper, and final exam.

Any requests for regrading or reconsideration of a grade must be submitted in writing and include a detailed justification, including an explanation of what you believed the instrucdtor overlooked. Verbal requests will not be considered, and "I think I deserve a better grade" is not adequate justification.

Grade Component	Weight

Grading guidelines: Note that some assignments are evaluated subjectively:

B: means meets and occasionally exceeds the course/assignment requirements

C: means minimally meets the course/assignment requirements

Honor Code

All work performed in this course will be subject to GMU's Honor Code. Students are expected to do their own work in the course unless a group project is approved by the instructor. In papers and project reports, students are expected to write in their own words, rather than cutting-and-pasting from sources found on the Internet. When you do cite material from books, articles, and the Web, enclose the material in quotes and provide a reference. If a paragraph is used then it should be indented in the text (both left and right margins).

Assignments

Format: PDF is preferred, but I will accept: plain text, HTML, StarOffice/OpenOffice, Open Document Format, MS Office. Upload all assignments to Blackboard.

Style: Research papers should follow either the IEEE or ACM format and use the Chicago Manual of Style for guidance on citation style, usage, etc. (If you prefer a hard-copy reference, don't buy the big CMS. See the smaller A Manual for Writers by Kate Turabian). The easiest way to manage references and source citations is to use a citation manager such as Zotero.

Student programming projects must adhere to the CS Honor Code.

There a several Computer Labs available for general use by IT&E students, which are located on the Fairfax campus. For more information go to the web site at http://labs.ite.gmu.edu/.

Class Participation: Contribute to the in-class discussions, participate in online discussion topics posted on Blackboard. Some online discussion topics might be selected for grading.

Other Notes

There will be reading assignments; I expect that you have actually read them!
Lectures will augment reading material; lecture material will be asked about on assignments, project, and on final exam. Unless I explicitly state otherwise, assume all material will be on the exam.
Lecture slides (from textbook authors and from instructor's additional material) will be posted on Blackboard.
Course content:
Some material you may already know (good! that's review!)
Some material you may have learned earlier and have forgotten (good! you'll be reminded)
Some material you may know more than the instructor (good! share it!).
Turn cell phones to silent mode; if you need to make an urgent call, leave the classroom. If you need to text, check emails, or other activity, do not disturb other students.
Call or email the instructor if you anticipate being late or absent.
Personal Safety and Security: The Mason Alert system provides emergency information of various sorts. Students can sign up for it by visiting the web site https://ready.gmu.edu/masonalert/. Students are also reminded that an emergency poster exists in each classroom explaining what to do in the event of crises and that further information about emergency procedures exists on https://ready.gmu.edu/.
Computer and IT Security: Visit GMU's IT http://itu.gmu.edu/ computer security web site regularly. Norton AntiVirus Software is free to download for all GMU students/faculty/staff.
